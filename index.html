<p>
Generalised self-consistent and automated domain discretisation for multi-scale geophysical models.
</p>

<p>
LibShingle: a computational research software library providing a high-level abstraction to spatial discretisation, or mesh generation, for domains containing complex, fractal-like boundaries that characterise those in numerical simulations of geophysical dynamics.  This is accompanied by a compact, shareable and necessarily complete description of the domain discretisation.
</p>

<p>
Geophysical model domains typically contain irregular, complex fractal-like boundaries and physical processes that act over a wide range of scales. Constructing geographically constrained boundary-conforming spatial discretisations of these domains with flexible use of anisotropic, fully unstructured meshes is a challenge. The problem contains a wide range of scales and a relatively large, heterogeneous constraint parameter space. Approaches are commonly ad hoc, model or application specific and insufficiently described. Development of new spatial domains is frequently time-consuming, hard to repeat, error prone and difficult to ensure consistent due to the significant human input required. As a consequence, it is difficult to reproduce simulations, ensure a provenance in model data handling and initialisation, and a challenge to conduct model intercomparisons rigorously. Moreover, for flexible unstructured meshes, there is additionally a greater potential for inconsistencies in model initialisation and forcing parameters. This library introduces a consistent approach to unstructured mesh generation for geophysical models, that is automated, quick-to-draft and repeat, and provides a rigorous and robust approach that is consistent to the source data throughout. The approach is enabling further new research in complex multi-scale domains, difficult or not possible to achieve with existing methods.

<h2>
<a name="outline" class="anchor" href="#outline"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Verification test engine</h2>

<p>
Includes a selection of examples, from a relatively straight-forward high-level GUI-driven interaction accessible to modellers new to mesh generation, to complex low-level development communicating with the LibShingle library.  Python interaction is used within the source, in generating documentation and in example Jupyter notebooks.
</p>

<p>
A verification test engine is continuously run in response to source code changes, some of which is tested under <a href="http://travis-ci.org/shingleproject/Shingle">Travis</a>.
