Generalised self-consistent and automated domain discretisation for multi-scale geophysical models.

A computational research software library providing a high-level abstraction to spatial discretisation, or mesh generation, for domains containing complex, fractal-like boundaries that characterise those in numerical simulations of geophysical dynamics. This is accompanied by a compact, shareable and necessarily complete description of the domain discretisation.
